# Biography

I am interested in how cells organize themselves to build complex structures and how cells work together to solve difficult tasks.

Currently I study such multi-cellular systems in developmental processes and within lymph nodes using statistical and agent-based models. Previously I built and analysed a partial differential equation model of the feedback-loop between the main signalling centers that orchestrate limb bud development.
